# Chapter 02: Building

The generated parser is produced from `termscript/Termscript.g` by `scripts/third_party/dparser`; CMake makes this a build dependency.

## Scope

This chapter documents the stable Termlib contract and the decisions applications must make when using it.

## Recommended pattern

Initialize option structures with their `*_options_init` function, check every returned status, and release each owned handle with its matching cleanup function. Keep borrowed pointers and file descriptors valid for the lifetime promised by the API.

## Reference

See `termlib.h` for exact signatures and `termlib.hpp` for the header-only C++ facade.
