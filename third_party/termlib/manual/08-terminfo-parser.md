# Chapter 08: Incremental Terminfo Parser

Only call `take_profile` after a final chunk has been accepted. Reset lets one parser object process another entry.

## Scope

This chapter documents the stable Termlib contract and the decisions applications must make when using it.

## Recommended pattern

Initialize option structures with their `*_options_init` function, check every returned status, and release each owned handle with its matching cleanup function. Keep borrowed pointers and file descriptors valid for the lifetime promised by the API.

## Reference

See `termlib.h` for exact signatures and `termlib.hpp` for the header-only C++ facade.
